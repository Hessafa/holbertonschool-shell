This is my second project completed during my Full Stack Software Engineering studies at Holberton School, through the Tuwaiq Academy program, where I am learning the fundamentals of software engineering. 🖥️




Time to dive into the Shell! In this project, I’m learning how to navigate the Linux file system, manipulate files, and work with commands like a pro.Now I know how to work with cd, ls, pwd, mv, cp, and more! 

Here’s what I’m tackling:

Getting comfy with navigating directories and using keyboard shortcuts ⌨️
Understanding man pages and shebangs 📝
Learning to manipulate files, create links, and work with commands like type and which 
Making scripts that are exactly two lines long and making them executable (chmod magic)!
